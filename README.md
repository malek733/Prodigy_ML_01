# House Price Prediction using linear regression
House price prediction using linear regression involves building a model that can predict the price of a house based on its features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, etc. Linear regression fits a straight line to the data, where the input features are used to predict the output (house price). The model learns the coefficients for each feature, which represent the contribution of that feature to the house price. By analyzing historical data on house prices and their corresponding features, the model can make predictions for new houses. However, it's important to note that linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the features and the target variable, and it may not capture more complex relationships present in the data. Regularization techniques or more advanced models may be needed to improve accuracy and handle non-linear relationships.
# dataset

7. households: Total number of households, a group of people residing within a home unit, for a block
8. medianIncome: Median income for households within a block of houses (measured in tens of thousands of US Dollars)
9. medianHouseValue: Median house value for households within a block (measured in US Dollars)
10. oceanProximity: Location of the house w.r.t ocean/sea
